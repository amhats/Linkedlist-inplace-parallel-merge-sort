# Linkedlist-parallel-inplace-parallel-merge-sort

The following project use cilk plus library to parallize a an in place merge sort algorithm that is going to be used parser(bpas parser).
Once complete it will consider the cache size (L1, L2, L3) of the system, number of cores to optimize the speed up.
